create new package.json:
  npm init
  remember that conceivably the name of the app you choose would show up
  in the npm registry if you published it, so it can matter)

remember that you can easily hook scripts via the package.json scripts key

install new package and save it in the package.json:
npm install moment --save
"^2.10.6" means update to any 2.x.y release but don't go to 3.x.y
"~2.10.6" means update to any 2.10.x release (only give me patches/bug-fixes)

Install all package.json dependencies even if node_modules is destroyed:
npm install

save as dev dependency (needed for development but not production app):
npm install jasmine-node --save-dev

global install:
npm install -g nodemon
global installs go to /usr/local/lib on Mac

sometimes you'll have multiple copies of the same dependency in node_modules
because each dependency pulls down it's own dependencies into its own module
directory

update to latest:
npm update

install a specific version:
npm install angular@1.4.7
