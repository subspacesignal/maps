<!-- HTML allows custom attributes on elements, browsers won't complain and
javascript can access them e.g.  -->
<h1 reply="hello back">hello</h1>

<!-- HTML5 introduced valid, official support if you name them "data-" e.g.  -->
<h1 data-reply="hello back">hello</h1>

in <table> elements:
  <td> "table data"
  <th> "table header"

there are more list types in html than just ul and ol

In HTML5:
No DTD needed:
<!DOCTYPE html>
Simple, case-insensitive way to specify character encoding:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
No need for type when importing .js, instead of:
<script type="text/javascript" src="scriptfile.js"></script>
You can just do:
<script src="scriptfile.js"></script>
For link tags you also don't need the type, instead of:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylefile.css">
You can just do:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylefile.css">

tags are case insensitive but lowercase is convention:
<p> or <P> works
attributes are the same

br, hr, link, meta are all 'void tags' i.e. tags which aren't allowed have
content between the tags

new tags:

section: a generic document section, can be used in conjunction with h1-h6 to
         define document structure.

article: an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or
         new article.

aside: a piece of content which is only slightly related to the rest of the page

header: the head of a section

footer: the footer of a section, could contain information about author,
        copyright etc.

nav: represents a section of the document intended for navigation

dialog: used to markup conversation content

figure: used to associate a caption together with some embedded content like a
        photo or video.

custom data attributes all being with "data-"

There are lots of events which can trigger .js code, a few examples are:
offline: when document has gone offline
onbeforeonload: before the document loads
onblur: when the window loses focus
onclick: mouse click
oncontextmenu
ondblclick
ondrag

Web Forms:
In HTML4:
Forms use <input> tags
Input elements use a type attribute to specify data type, there are the
following types:
text: free-form text field (usually free from line breaks)
password: same as text but with ******
checkbox: set of zero or more values from a predefined list, can check as many
          as you wish
radio: an enumerated value from a predefined list, can only pick one at a time
submit: free form button which initiates form submission
file: artibrary file with a MIME type and optionally a file name
image: unclear what this does? something like a coordinate into an image which
       initiates form submission
hidden: an arbitrary string not shown on the page
select: similar to radio but in a drop down menu?
textarea: free form text field usually with no restrictions on line breaks
button: a free form button which can trigger any event related to a button
Example:
<form action="http://example.com/cgiscript.pl" method="post">
   <p>
      <label for="firstname">first name: </label>
      <input type="text" id="firstname"><br />

      <label for="lastname">last name: </label>
      <input type="text" id="lastname"><br />

      <label for="email">email: </label>
      <input type="text" id="email"><br>

      <input type="radio" name="sex" value="male"> Male<br>
      <input type="radio" name="sex" value="female"> Female<br>
      <input type="submit" value="send"> <input type="reset">
   </p>
</form>

Web Forms 2.0 / <input> element in HTML5
datetime: date time in UTC timezone
datetime-local: a date time with no timezone information
date: year month day
month: a year and a month
week: a year and a week
time: hour minute seconds fractional seconds
number: only numerical values, step attribute defines precision, default step
        is 1.
range: for inputs which should be a value from a range of numbers
email: only emails allowed
url: only urls allowed

<output> element can be used to be a part of a form where output is sent by .js
         as a result of (for example) clicking an <input> button in the same
         form

placeholder attribute works on <input> and <textarea> elements:
  <input type="text" name="search" placeholder="search the web"/>
cannot contain carriage returns or line-feeds.

autofocus:
on page load automatically focus on a particular form field:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
   <body>
      <form action="/cgi-bin/html5.cgi" method="get">
         Enter email : <input type="text" name="newinput" autofocus/>
         <p>Try to submit using Submit button</p>
         <input type="submit" value="submit" />
      </form>
   </body>
</html>

required atrribute:
client side form validation without needing .js:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
   <body>
      <form action="/cgi-bin/html5.cgi" method="get">
         Enter email : <input type="text" name="newinput" required/>
         <p>Try to submit using Submit button</p>
         <input type="submit" value="submit" />
      </form>
   </body>
</html>

SVG:
is built into browsers:
<svg id="svgelem" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
   <circle id="redcircle" cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="red" />
</svg>

MathML is built in:
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
   <mrow>
      <msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup>
      <mo>+</mo>
      <msup><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msup>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup>
   </mrow>
</math>

Sessions/Cookies/Web Storage:
Pre-HTML5 there were HTTP session cookies
  used for storing structured data on the client side
  have drawbacks:
    cookies included on every request when often not needed
    when on HTTP then cookie is sent unencrypted (from a TLS/SSL perspective)
    on every request (a reason for encrypting the cookie contents itself)
    cookie sizes are effectively limited to around 4kb of data
HTML5 introduced 'session storage' and 'local storage'

Session storage:
intended for situations where a user is carrying out a single transaction but
could be carrying out multiple transactions simultaneously in different windows
For example: with normal cookies, if you were booking tickets from the same
             website in two different windows simultaneously, the site may get
             confused because the same cookie state is used in two places
             potentially with both windows overwriting each other's state.
             Session storage would allow for different pieces of state per
             window and then all session state would be deleted one all windows
             are closed.
Session storage can be accessed in the JavaScript console:
sessionStorage

Local storage:
Used to store user data which can span multiple windows but which lasts beyond
the current session, even when all windows have been closed. Example use-cases
include storing megabytes of information such as partially edited documents, a
user's mailbox etc. for performance reasons.
Can be accessed in the JavaScript console:
localStorage
You can do:
localStorage.remove('key');
or:
localStorage.clear(); // clear everything (for this domain presumeably)

Web SQL:
considered deprecated, see indexeddb below
There is a browser SQL database
Core methods: openDatabase, transaction, executeSql
var db = openDatabase('mydb', '1.0', 'Test DB', 2 * 1024 * 1024);

Server Sent Events (SSE) / <eventsource> element
  The <eventsource> element opens a persistent connection to a server so that a
  server could send data to a client only when there is some and avoid polling
  <div id="sse">
    <eventsource src="/cgi-bin/ticker.cgi" />
  </div>

IndexedDB:
local browser database suggested to replace web sql
stores key value pairs
non-relational unlike web sql
mostly aysnchronous api
not a structured query language
can access any data from the same domain

Web Sockets:
bidirectional communication technology
operates on a single socket
exposed via .js interface
once a websocket is open:
  call .send() method to send data to the server
  listen to onmessage event handler to receive data from server
  call .close() to terminate any existing connection
Create a websocket object:
var Socket = new WebSocket(url, [protocal] ); // protocol is optional
Socket.readyState
  readonly
  possible values: 0 - not yet established, 1 - established and communication
                   is possible, 2 - going through closing handshake, 3 - closed
                   or could not be opened.
Socket.bufferedAmount
  readonly
  the number of bytes of UTF-8 text which have been queued using .send()

WebSocket events:
  open (event handler: Socket.onopen) - connection established
  message (event handler: Socket.onmessage) - client recieves data from server
  error (event handler: Socket.onerror) - an error in communication occured
  close (event handler: Socket.onclose) - connection closed

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
   <head>
      <script type="text/javascript">
         function WebSocketTest()
         {
            if ("WebSocket" in window)
            {
               alert("WebSocket is supported by your Browser!");
               var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:9998/echo");
               ws.onopen = function()
               {
                  ws.send("Message to send");
                  alert("Message is sent...");
               };
               ws.onmessage = function (evt)
               {
                  var received_msg = evt.data;
                  alert("Message is received...");
               };
               ws.onclose = function()
               {
                  alert("Connection is closed...");
               };
            }
            else
            {
               alert("WebSocket NOT supported by your Browser!");
            }
         }
      </script>
   </head>
   <body>
      <div id="sse">
         <a href="javascript:WebSocketTest()">Run WebSocket</a>
      </div>
   </body>
</html>

Canvas:
<canvas id="mycanvas" width="100" height="100"></canvas>

Video:
(broswer will play first source it can support)
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
   <body>
      <video  width="300" height="200" controls autoplay>
         <source src="/html5/foo.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
         <source src="/html5/foo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
         Your browser does not support the video element.
      </video>
   </body>
</html>
attributes:
autoplay, autobuffer, controls, height, loop, preload, poster, src, width

Audio:
<audio src="foo.wav" controls autoplay>
   Your browser does not support the <audio> element.
</audio>

There are many media events (some) examples:
abort, canplay, ended, error, pause, play, progress, seeked, volumechange

Geolocation:
.js api can get latitude and longtitude
var geolocation = navigator.geolocation;
.getCurrentPosition()
.watchPosition() // get periodic updates on current location
.clearWatch()
Position object properties (some examples):
coords, cooards.latitude, cooards.accuracy, cooards.heading, cooards.speed
Errors: 0 - UNKKNOWN_ERROR, 1 - PERMISSION_DENIED, 2 - POSITION_UNAVAILABLE,
        3 - TIMEOUT
Position options:
  enableHighAccuracy
  timeout
  maximumAge

Microdata:
  way to provide additional semantics in your page
  lets you define your own custom elements and embed custom properties in your
  page
  is like name value pairs, there are 'items' and 'properties'
  can later be accessed via .js api?

  <html>
   <body>
      <div itemscope>
         <p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Zara</span>.</p>
      </div>
      <div itemscope>
         <p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Nuha</span>.</p>
      </div>
   </body>
</html>

there is itemscope, itemtype, itemid, itemprop, itemref
function supports_microdata_api() {
   return !!document.getItems;
}

Drag and Drop Events
This will let you drag actual objects around the screen
There are multiple events and an Event object which has a readonly attribute
called dataTransfer
DataTransfer object holds data about drag and drop operations.

Web Workers
client-side browser JavaScript is all single threaded
Web Workers allow you to do work concurrently without blocking the UI

Web Messaging:
Usually it would be an error if your page tried to send data to an ad iframe in
the page, Web Messaging can allow you to pass it as a message event

CORS (cross origin resource sharing)
allows restricted resources from another domain in the page
Seems to allow you to make requests to other domains as long as the server has
CORS enabled?

Web RTC:
browser to browser voice calling/video chat/P2P file sharing
APIs:
MediaStream
RTCPeerConnection
RTCDataChannel
